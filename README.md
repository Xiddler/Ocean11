## Ocean11 folder

(added 2020-01-03_01:14)

### This folder is related to my Digital Ocean droplet.

It seems that my ISP has prevented me from using SSH to access remote servers.

So, to circumvent this I have this folder as a github repo which I can use to transfer files between my laptop and my DO droplet.

### Using the git commmands:

git push origin master
and
git pull
... depending on where the push originates.

I added this in MarkText. Huh?
Yup, MarkText is a fine markdown viewer/editor. Only downside is that it uses Electron. But, hey, it is still viable...



### this is a line using the markdown syntax to highlight.

Marktext does a __great__ job of _italicising_ inline without **too** much hassle.

We know that converting .md files into html (for publishing to the web) is not a big deal.

__Therefore__ why not use markdown. And why not use Marktext. They appear to be a great match. Once your computer has the proper resources.
